      <h1>History of Web Design Thoughts</h1>
      <p>Written by James Enoch</p>

      I thought this was an interesting article which I was able to learn a bit from. 
       I've read some articles about the 'history of the web' before, but not about the history of web design itself.
       As I read the article there were parts where I was a bit nostalgic. I think a lot of people in my age group (20-30s) were utilizing some of these features without even realizing it.

       I remember having to update a 'Flash' plugin. 
       I would receive that prompt, and many times ignore it. 
       Seeing some features on a web page not work, as a kid I was pretty much able to figure out what it's purpose was.
       I also remember manipulating my own HTML without really understanding what I was doing. I just wanted to make this thing look cooler.
       That thing was Myspace! I remember customizing my page: fonts, colors, background images, word boxes, importing web streamers for music etc.
       Then you move onto cell phones. There were growing pains there. With some websites looking awkward or not responsive on the web browser of your device yet.
       Now, everything works incredibly quickly and very efficiently most of the time. It's really amazing the technology we have in our pockets.
       It's been really cool to see it progress throughout the years, even if I wasn't always cognizant of it.

      As far as the future of web design goes I am not sure I am up to date on all of the current developments to really understand where it is headed. 
      From reading the article I am assuming everything will have much greater control for both the developers/designers and the users. 
      It seems like there are already tools to manage and manipulate elements easier, to bundle them together to streamline some processes and to more easily update them separately. 
      Maybe on the user side of things, users would have some "control" over the design. Maybe that would be choosing from templates, or an interactive way of "customizing" a site via a tool kit. 
      Sort of like how you could hack your HTML on Myspace, but without actually getting into code. 
      Now that I am starting to better understand these concepts, it will be interesting to see how the keep developing in the future.
